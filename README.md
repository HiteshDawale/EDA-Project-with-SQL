Introduction
This project aims to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on an Orders dataset stored in a MySQL database. The analysis involves connecting to the database, extracting relevant data, and applying various data analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights. This helps in understanding customer behavior, order trends, and overall business performance.

Dataset
The dataset consists of order-related information stored in a MySQL database. The key attributes in the dataset include:

Order Id
Order Date
Ship Mode
Segment
Country
City
State
Postal Code
Region
Category
Sub Category
Product Id
Cost Price
List Price
Quantity
Discount Percent
Database Connection
The data is stored in a MySQL database, and the connection is established using the mysql-connector-python library. SQL queries are used to retrieve data, which is then processed using pandas for analysis.

Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the analysis:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
mysql-connector-python
jupyter
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly mysql-connector-python jupyter
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Connecting to the Database: Establishing a connection to the MySQL database.
Loading the Data: Executing SQL queries to fetch the required data.
Cleaning the Data: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and converting existing ones to appropriate formats for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics of numerical columns.
Distribution of categorical variables.
Correlation matrix to understand relationships between numerical features.
Data Visualization
Univariate Analysis: Histograms, box plots, and count plots to analyze individual features.
Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to study relationships between pairs of features.
Multivariate Analysis: Pair plots and grouped bar charts to explore interactions among multiple features.
Insights
Analysis of order volume over time.
Patterns in customer purchasing behavior.
Trends in product popularity and sales.
Impact of different shipping modes and regions on order values.
Effect of discounts on quantity ordered and sales.
Conclusion
The EDA provides a comprehensive understanding of the Orders dataset, highlighting significant trends and insights. These findings can inform business decisions, improve operational efficiency, and guide further analysis.

Future Work
Potential future work includes:

Predictive modeling to forecast future sales and order volumes.
Clustering analysis to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
Time series analysis for detailed trends and seasonality effects.
How to Use
Set up the MySQL database connection parameters in the configuration file.
Run the Jupyter notebook to view the analysis:
